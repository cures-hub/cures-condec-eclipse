# cures-condec-eclipse

The CURES ConDec Eclipse plug-in enables the user to capture and explore decision knowledge in Eclipse. Decision knowledge covers knowledge about decisions, the problems they address, solution proposals, their context, and justifications (rationale). The user can capture decision knowledge in code and commit messages and explore relevant knowledge for code. Relevant knowledge is also extracted from the JIRA project.
